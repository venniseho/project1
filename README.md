Exploratory text-adventure game for CSC111: Introduction to Computer Science II at the University of Toronto. 
Collaborative project with @RF216.
Professor approved posting of the starter code.

The goal of the game is to find three objects - your student ID (T-Card), exam cheat sheet, and your lucky pen - before your exam starts!
The player only has a set number of moves to explore campus, find the items, and get to the exam centre. 
Along the way, the player may have to overcome obstacles (mini-games), and find other objects to aid them in their quest or for bonus points.
